🧠 Super Admin — Core Concept

The Super Admin is the top-level operator of the entire SaaS platform, not a tenant.
This role exists outside of any tenant’s data boundaries and controls the whole ecosystem.

🎯 Core Responsibilities
Capability	Description
🏢 Manage Tenants	Create, suspend, or delete tenant accounts.
💳 Manage Subscriptions	Assign features (Money Loan, BNPL, Pawnshop), set plan types (Free, Standard, Pro), and handle renewals.
👥 Manage Tenant Admins	View or reset tenant admin credentials, verify identity, handle escalations.
⚙️ Configure Global Settings	Set global loan parameters, default templates, system-wide interest rate policies, etc.
📊 Platform Analytics	View total tenants, active users, usage per feature, and overall revenue trends.
🔐 Manage Platform Roles	Add platform-level users (support agents, accountants) and control their access.
📨 Notifications	Send announcements, maintenance alerts, or policy updates to all tenants.
🧭 Super Admin Menu Structure (Required)

A clean, scalable structure for your Angular Material sidenav, designed for clarity and expansion:

🏠 Dashboard

Overview of total tenants, active subscriptions, and revenue.

Graphs showing tenant growth, most-used features, and monthly income.

🏢 Tenants Management

Tenant List — view all tenants, search, filter by status.

Add Tenant — onboard a new tenant manually.

Tenant Details — open a tenant to view its users, branches, features, usage stats.

Suspend / Activate Tenant — toggle availability instantly.

💳 Subscriptions

Subscription Plans — define billing plans and their price points.

Assign Features — choose which features each plan includes (Money Loan, BNPL, Pawnshop).

Billing & Payments — view tenant billing history and invoices.

Trial & Expiry Management — monitor subscription expirations and renewals.

🧰 Features

Feature Flags — central control for system-wide features (enable/disable for tenants).

Feature Analytics — usage per feature type (e.g., 60% use Money Loan, 40% BNPL).

👥 Users & Roles

Platform Users — manage internal Super Admins, support staff, auditors.

Role Management — define access scopes for internal staff.

Access Logs / Audit Trail — track who changed tenant data or features.

📊 Reports

Tenant Activity Report — logins, feature usage, recent activity.

Subscription Revenue — income by plan, by period.

Feature Utilization — how many tenants are using each system.

System Logs — backend audit trails and API actions.

⚙️ Platform Settings

Global Interest Templates — default interest or fee models across the platform.

Notification Templates — standardized messages for system updates or billing alerts.

System Email / SMTP Settings — configure global outbound email system.

Backup & Restore — manage database or configuration backups.

🔔 Announcements

Compose and send global messages to all tenants.

Used for downtime notices, new features, and general communication.

👤 My Account

Logout button.

🔐 Tenant Feature Access (Required)

Each tenant record must include the following fields:

Field	Example
tenantId	1
tenantName	ABC Lending Corp.
isActive	true
subscriptionPlan	Pro
featuresEnabled	[ 'MoneyLoan', 'BNPL' ]
startDate	2025-01-01
expiryDate	2026-01-01

These control what the tenant can access when logging in.

For example:

Tenant with ['MoneyLoan'] → sees only Money Loan modules.

Tenant with ['MoneyLoan', 'Pawnshop'] → sees both.

This filtering happens automatically in the UI and backend authorization layer.

🌐 Multi-Tenant Feature Control (Required)

This is a core part of the Super Admin dashboard, inside Tenant Details view.

📋 Display Example
Tenant: ABC Lending Corp.
Status: Active

[✔] Money Loan  
[☐] Buy Now, Pay Later  
[✔] Pawnshop  

[ Save Changes ]


When Super Admin toggles and saves:

The system updates the tenant’s record.

Tenant’s users immediately gain or lose access to the corresponding features.

Their UI menus and backend permissions reflect this change instantly.

⚡ Role Hierarchy Summary (Required)
Level	Scope	Role	Access Responsibility
🧠 Global	Platform-wide	Super Admin	Manages tenants, subscriptions, features, and analytics.
👨‍💼 Tenant-level	Within one company	Tenant Admin	Manages users, branches, and system setup.
🏢 Branch-level	Within tenant	Branch Manager / Officer / Collector / Auditor	Handles daily loan operations.
👤 End-user	Customer	Customer	Views own loans or makes payments.

Implement this please 🧩 1. Core RBAC Roles
Here’s a recommended role hierarchy for a Money Loan SaaS system:

Role Description Example Permissions
Tenant Owner / Admin Full access to tenant settings, user management, reports Manage all users, configure loan settings, view all reports
Branch Manager Manages one or more branches under the tenant Approve loans, manage customers, oversee collections
Loan Officer / Encoder Handles loan applications, client onboarding Create loans, add clients, update records
Collector / Cashier Handles payment collection, receipts, and deposits Record payments, view schedules, print receipts
Auditor / Accountant View financial summaries, audit logs, reports only Read-only access to transactions and reports
Customer (optional) Portal access for clients to view loan status View own loans, make online payments

⚡ 4. Multi-Tenant Considerations

Each tenant (company) should have:

Its own users, branches, loans, and collections data (isolated via tenant ID).

Admin(s) who can manage only their tenant’s data.

Customizable loan settings, interest rules, and fees.

Optional custom roles per tenant (if you want more flexibility).
