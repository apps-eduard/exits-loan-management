## üîÑ Business Logic & Triggers

### 1. Credit Limit Enforcement
```typescript
// Before creating a purchase
if (customer.available_credit < purchase.financed_amount) {
  throw new Error('Insufficient credit limit');
}

// After purchase approval
customer.available_credit -= purchase.financed_amount;
customer.outstanding_balance += purchase.total_payable;
```

### 2. Installment Calculation

#### Flat Interest Method
```typescript
interest = (financed_amount * interest_rate * term_months) / 100
total_payable = financed_amount + interest
installment_amount = total_payable / number_of_installments
```

#### Diminishing Interest Method
```typescript
// Interest calculated on remaining balance each period
// Uses amortization formula for equal payments
```

### 3. Payment Processing (Automated Trigger)
```sql
-- Trigger: process_bnpl_payment_trigger
-- Executes after payment insert

1. Update purchase:
   - Increment amount_paid
   - Update last_payment_date
   - Change status to 'completed' if fully paid

2. Update customer:
   - Increment total_paid
   - Decrease outstanding_balance
   - Increase available_credit
   - Update payment behavior counters

3. Update next installment:
   - Mark as paid/partial based on amount
   - Set payment_date
   - Recalculate balance
```

### 4. Balance Sync (Automated Trigger)
```sql
-- Trigger: update_bnpl_purchase_balance_trigger
-- Executes after installment update

Recalculates purchase.outstanding_balance from sum of installment balances
```

## üîê Security & Validation

### Tenant Isolation
```typescript
// All queries must include tenant_id
const customers = await db.query(`
  SELECT * FROM bnpl_customers 
  WHERE tenant_id = $1
`, [tenantId]);

// Verify ownership before operations
const purchase = await db.query(`
  SELECT * FROM bnpl_purchases 
  WHERE id = $1 AND tenant_id = $2
`, [purchaseId, tenantId]);
```

### Business Rules Validation
```typescript
// Credit limit check
if (customer.available_credit < purchase.financed_amount) {
  return { error: 'Insufficient credit limit' };
}

// Minimum down payment
if (purchase.down_payment < purchase.total_amount * 0.1) {
  return { error: 'Minimum 10% down payment required' };
}

// Valid installment count
if (purchase.number_of_installments < 1 || purchase.number_of_installments > 36) {
  return { error: 'Installments must be between 1 and 36' };
}

// Payment cannot exceed balance
if (payment.payment_amount > purchase.outstanding_balance) {
  return { error: 'Payment exceeds outstanding balance' };
}
```

## üì± Integration Points

  items: purchase.items.map(item => ({
    id: item.inventory_item_id,
    quantity: item.quantity
  }))
});
```

### Accounting System (Optional)
```typescript
// When purchase is created
await accountingService.recordSale({
  amount: purchase.total_amount,
  receivable: purchase.financed_amount,
  down_payment: purchase.down_payment
});

// When payment is received
await accountingService.recordReceipt({
  amount: payment.payment_amount,
  method: payment.payment_method
});
```

### SMS/Email Service
```typescript
// Send payment reminder
await notificationService.send({
  method: 'sms',
  to: customer.phone_number,
  message: `Reminder: Your payment of ‚Ç±${installment.amount_due} is due on ${installment.due_date}`
});
```
